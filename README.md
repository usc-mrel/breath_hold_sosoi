# breath_hold_sosoi

Repository contains example code and data for breath-hold stack-of-spiral out-in lung MRI at 0.55T. 

Publication: **Single breath-hold volumetric lung imaging at 0.55T using stack-of-spiral (SoS) out-in balanced SSFP**  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.30386


The reconstruction is 3D SPIRiT with l1 Wavelet constrain. The reconstruction can be run on GPU, however, a large memory is required.
